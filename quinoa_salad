for the dressing
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons warm water
1 or 2 large cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon agave nectar
juice of one lemon
salt and pepper to taste (I started with 1/4 teaspoon salt)
a handful of parsley leaves

for the salad
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
8 leaves romaine lettuce
3 large carrots, peeled
1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved
3/4 cup chopped herbs of choice (see notes)
Parmesan cheese for serving (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS
Puree the dressing ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Store in fridge until ready to use.
Cook the quinoa according to package directions. When finished cooking, chill in the fridge or freezer. The texture of the salad is better when the quinoa is cool and crumbles a little more easily (instead of hot and sticky).
Shred the lettuce into long, thin pieces (or to whatever texture you like). Cut the carrots into a few big chunks and mince them in the food processor with 3-5 pulses. Toss the tomatoes, carrots, and chopped herbs together. Toss the cooled quinoa with the dressing; add the carrots, tomatoes, and herb mixture. When ready to serve, toss with the lettuce.
NOTES
For my herbs, I did 1/4 cup each of basil, parsley, and green onions (plus a little lemon thyme! yum).
