Ingredients
2 Cups Fresh Basil Leaves
2 Cloves Garlic
1/3 Cup Pine Nuts
3/4 Cup Parmesan Cheese, Fresh
1/4 Teaspoon Salt
1/4 Teaspoon Pepper
3/4 Cup Olive Oil

Notes: last time I just added everything and mixed until it was a pesto texture. The family really prefered the taste of a lighter green over adding more basil flavor.

Instructions
Add the fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to the bowl of your food processor. Pulse 5 times until a coarse mixture forms.
Turn the food processor on low and slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream.
Serve the pesto immediately or store in a small bowl covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator.
